<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>
  Hey folks, I'm Shivam, a third-year B.Tech CSE student hustling through the
  corridors of Graphic Era University. Patna, Bihar, is where I call home, a
  city pulsating with culture and history. Now, if you were to describe me in a
  word, it'd probably be "introvert." Yep, I'm that guy who prefers a quiet
  corner with a good book over a loud party any day. But don't get me wrong,
  once you crack my shell, you'll find I'm as friendly as they come.

  Coding, ah, that's my bread and butter. I've been tinkering with C++ since
  forever. There's something about the logic and structure of programming
  languages that just clicks with me. Recently, though, I've been itching to
  expand my horizons. I dipped my toes into web development, starting with HTML.
  It's been a wild ride so far, but I'm loving every minute of it.

  Now, let's talk downtime. When I'm not buried under a mountain of code or
  textbooks, you'll find me unwinding in various ways. I'm a sucker for those
  addictive memes on social media, they're like tiny snippets of entertainment
  that never fail to put a smile on my face. Movies are another passion of mine.
  Whether it's the latest blockbuster or an indie gem, count me in. And music?
  Oh, music speaks to my soul. I could spend hours getting lost in the melodies,
  letting the rhythm carry me away.

<p>
  But amidst all the hustle and bustle of life, there's one constant that keeps
  me grounded ,my mom. She's not just my mom; she's my rock, my confidante, my
  everything. Her unwavering support and love mean the world to me. I guess you
  could say she's the reason I strive to be the best version of myself every
  single day.
